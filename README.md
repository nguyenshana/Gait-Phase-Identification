## Setup to do before running the program


### Change Excel Data
Remember to change (or at least check):
1. Set staring row amount
2. Set filepath variable
3. excel_data_df needs to read the new file
4. Set input length
5. Add chart title [the part that says: ax.set_title(...)]


## What I use to run the code
I like using Spyder as my IDE because it has a console and a place where graphs show up, but you can run it however you like!
