# Gait-Phase-Identification

Algorithm to detect gait phase.
Can be altered to detect in real time. 

## Main code is in: hipCalc-sageMotion.py

## For hipCalc-sageMotion.py:
As well as shankAccelZ.py, footAVyshankAVz.py, multipleSignals.py

1. Can change the inputs for main() at the very bottom
2. Change 'pathToFolder' variable in main() to have the correct path to your excel files

 For gyroscopeAlgorithm.py:

Remember to change (or at least check):
1. Change pathToFolder to your path to the excel files (line 31)
2. Check if frequency is correct (line 88)
3. Set participant name (line 94) (possible names are in 'trials' on line 38)
4. Run the code

### What I use to run the code
I like using Spyder as my IDE because it has a console and a place where graphs show up, but you can run it however you like!
