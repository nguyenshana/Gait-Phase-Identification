# 020_Angle_Feedback_Test Folder

These files are based on Sagemotion's given Hip Ext and Gait Detection code. The Gait Detection code (folder 02010 with TSA_functions.py) is copied over, and Hip Ext code (folder 01111 with HipExt_funcs.py) has code snippets added. 

You can ask Shana/Samira for the 02010 and 01111 folders if you can't download them from SageMotion's UI yourself.


## To do items :

## In general:
- make sure the sensors are called properly

### core.py
- Code from Hip Ext isn't brought over yet

### config.json
- "last_connect_feedback": not sure which one to use nor what they mean

### info.json
- has some duplicates; figure out which one to keep
